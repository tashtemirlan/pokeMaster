## üå≥ Project Ideology

As a lifelong Pok√©mon enthusiast, I set out to create a Pok√©mon game that captures the excitement of capturing, training, and exploring with any Pok√©mon you‚Äôve ever dreamed of. This project is entirely free, works offline, and provides users with the freedom to save or retrieve their progress from the cloud seamlessly. 

### Project Highlights

- **üìñ Pok√©dex Tracking**: Track your personal journey through the Pok√©dex, seeing all Pok√©mon you‚Äôve encountered or captured along the way.
- **üé≤ Map Screen - The Pok√©mon Roulette**: An interactive roulette on the map screen gives users the chance to obtain new Pok√©mon randomly‚Äîspin the wheel and see which Pok√©mon is destined to join your team!
- **üéí Inventory Management**: Take full control of your Pok√©mon on the inventory screen, where you can add or remove team members, view detailed stats, evolve Pok√©mon, or even release them back into the wild. Your Pok√©mon journey is truly in your hands!
- **üèÜ Challenge Screen**: Step up and prove your strength by battling against the most formidable gym leaders and contest champions. Earn stars, unlock achievements, and aim to be legendary in the Pok√©mon world!

### Screens Overview

1. **üè™ Store Screen**: Visit the store to purchase Pok√© Balls and view your current inventory of essential items.
2. **üéí User Inventory**: View and manage all your Pok√©mon and items here‚Äîorganize your team and prepare for adventure!
3. **üó∫Ô∏è Map Page**: Explore the world map to search for locations and discover Pok√©mon from every region.
4. **‚öîÔ∏è Challenge Page**: Test your might against the strongest opponents and cement your place as a champion.
5. **üìö Pok√©dex Page**: Your ultimate guide to the Pok√©mon world! Track all Pok√©mon, read detailed information, and see which ones you've yet to encounter.

## üìä Database Structure

The application uses a structured database approach to manage user data, challenges, and the Pok√©dex efficiently. Below are the key components and their roles:

This box contains data related to user challenges, contests, and user currency.

- **`PokeChallenge`**: Stores all challenges for the user.
- **`PokeContest`**: Stores all contest data for the user.
- **`UserMoneys`**: Holds the user‚Äôs gold balance.
- **`initialized`**: Holds if system initialized.

### **2. `PokemonUserPokedex` Box**
This box contains the Pok√©dex information and all Pok√©mon data, facilitating global Pok√©mon management.

- **`Pokedex`**: A dictionary containing all Pok√©mon details.
- **`pokemons`**: Stores global Pok√©mon data for efficient access across the app.

### **3. `PokemonUserInventory` Box**
This box houses user-specific data, including inventory, team, and Pok√© Balls.

- **`PokeUserInventory`**: Stores all Pok√©mon owned by the user.
- **`PokeballsUserInventory`**: Holds the user‚Äôs collection of Pok√© Balls.

### **4. `PokemonUserTeam` Box**
