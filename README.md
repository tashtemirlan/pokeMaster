## üìä Database Structure

The application uses a structured database approach to manage user data, challenges, and the Pok√©dex efficiently. Below are the key components and their roles:

### **1. `PokemonUserDataBase` Box**
This box contains data related to user challenges, contests, and user currency.

- **`PokeChallenge`**: Stores all challenges for the user.
- **`PokeContest`**: Stores all contest data for the user.
- **`UserMoneys`**: Holds the user‚Äôs gold balance.

### **2. `PokemonUserPokedex` Box**
This box contains the Pok√©dex information and all Pok√©mon data, facilitating global Pok√©mon management.

- **`Pokedex`**: A dictionary containing all Pok√©mon details.
- **`pokemons`**: Stores global Pok√©mon data for efficient access across the app.

### **3. `PokemonUserInventory` Box**
This box houses user-specific data, including inventory, team, and Pok√© Balls.

- **`PokeUserInventory`**: Stores all Pok√©mon owned by the user.
- **`UserTeam`**: Contains the user‚Äôs current Pok√©mon team.
- **`PokeballsUserInventory`**: Holds the user‚Äôs collection of Pok√© Balls.
